discovering what already is
Im just here trying to find out how discover-able the discovered really is.


How discoverable is this period of instruction. As if im an alien and never had been on earth or have ever seen this form of technology before, I need to find the discover-ability in this, holding my hand you will. Humans suck at explaining and showing the dynamics at this brave new world of typing on a screen that more than half the world cann't even comperehend to what it actually stands for, for that its application is meaningless until disocvered through being discover-able. Help me figure how to discover what happens next. Commit I shall, only after I see step 1 to step end.
